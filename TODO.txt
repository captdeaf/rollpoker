Suggestions:
* Flash on your turn

BUGS:
* Can't duplicate: kqq87 beat kqqtt somehow? Winner was all-in from Flop.
* Queued: Bet, should be Call.
* On raise, MinBet is set improperly if Player.Bet = 25 and CurBet = 50.

TODO:
* Tournament features
* Blind schedules
* Pause blinds
* Ranking list
* Menu: Quit game, return to registry, Kick Player, kickstart game
* Admin: Add Owner on creation, and sub-admins.
* Cash game support
  * Buyin button
  * Cashout button

SUGGESTIONS:
* Muck cards or show 'em on loss?
* Graying overlay of cards for "Checked" "Called", etc, if you've already
  gone.
* Show backs of cards, grayed out, for "folded" ?
* Auto-checkfold for idle players
* Disable and discolor Bet Plaque when not able to do anything
* index.html should store results in cookies and show them to reduce # of
  "What was the game I created?" - or find rooms by query.

FIXED:
* Pre-check, Pre-fold
* Draggable conflicts w/ safari scrolling: Overflow: auto on dragging div?
* Buttons don't work on touchscreen devices
* Disabling "selectable" prevents text boxes from being selected on mobile devices / iOS.
* "Your bet" instead of "TURN"
* "Checked" instead of "Called"
* Bet Text box isn't editable
* Winning hand isn't shown.
* Log of what's going on.
* Dealer token
* Encrypt player cards
* Show SB, BB.
* Bigger Bet buttons & input (touchscreen, for crying out loud)
* When folded, remove bet plaque and cards
* All-In didn't chop off player chips at BetAmount. Fixed.
* Players need to bust out at end of round if no chips.
* "Calls with 0" instead of "Checks"
* Whose turn is it? Show!
* Overlay messages? (Add PlayerId to LogItem)
* Events: Triggers for JS and for UI animations.
* Indicate pre-check and pre-fold somehow.
* Fake AIs:
  * Weights (prefer to call rather than raise, and raise rather than fold)
  * Wait random amount of time, from 0secs to 2s after OnTurn
* JS Web Desktop Notifications
* Sanity checks before and after every command
  * Only one player per table has TURN.
  * At most one player per table has BET.
  * Total amount of money (Players.Bet + Tables.Pot + Players.Chips) beforehand equals after.
  * A player has TURN, OR a command is queued // command returns true or RUN
* BUGGGGGG: Multiple people had TURN (TryCheck was culprit. Fixed.)
* Bet plaque shows incorrect number. Bet 50 -> "Raise 0" "Raise 25" when
  should be 50. etc.
* Reduce limit() to 1 for polling
* Combine log events and only publish on SaveGame
* Show all-in cards instead of hiding until winner is declared.
* Add All-in cards to log when auto-play is enabled.
* Add bet amounts to green status div and player state. Use DisplayState?
* USE FIREBASE USERS.
