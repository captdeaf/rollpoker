BUGS:
* Bet plaque shows compared to minbet. Bet 50 -> "Raise 0"
* Show all-in cards instead of hiding until winner is declared.
* Add All-in cards to log when auto-play is enabled.
* Add bet amounts to green status div and player state. Use DisplayState?

TODO:
* Graying overlay of cards for "Checked" "Called", etc, if you've already
  gone.
* Show backs of cards, grayed out, for "folded" ?
* Auto-checkfold for idle players
* Disable and discolor Bet Plaque when not able to do anything
* Pre-check, Pre-fold
* Muck cards or show 'em on loss?
* Tournament features
* Blind schedules
* Pause blinds
* Ranking list
* Overlay messages? (Add PlayerId to LogItem)
* Admin panel: Quit game, return to registry, Kick Player, kickstart game
* Cash game support

* index.html should store results in cookies and show them to reduce # of
  "What was the game I created?"

FIXED:
* Draggable conflicts w/ safari scrolling: Overflow: auto on dragging div?
* Buttons don't work on touchscreen devices
* Disabling "selectable" prevents text boxes from being selected on mobile devices / iOS.
* "Your bet" instead of "TURN"
* "Checked" instead of "Called"
* Bet Text box isn't editable
* Winning hand isn't shown.
* Log of what's going on.
* Dealer token
* Encrypt player cards
* Show SB, BB.
* Bigger Bet buttons & input (touchscreen, for crying out loud)
* When folded, remove bet plaque and cards
* All-In didn't chop off player chips at BetAmount. Fixed.
* Players need to bust out at end of round if no chips.
* "Calls with 0" instead of "Checks"
