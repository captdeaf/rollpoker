Hmmmm -

"Encrypt" players' cards using their "passwords"? That could be a pretty nifty way to
give the same document to every player w/o leaking each card ... Saving a shitload of
programming and calls!

Salt using hand ID (random) + password, so that if a person gets the same hand twice,
it's not recognizable.
